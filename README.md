# JuliaLogos

A shell script for downloading Julia Org logos.

To submit an org here, add it to the `orgnames` file. I'll run the script and sync the logos periodically.

To run the script yourself, create a file called `github_username` and put your username in it.
Also create a `github_token` file with the Github token.
